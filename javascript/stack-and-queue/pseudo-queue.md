## Feature Tasks

- Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
- Do not use an existing queue.

### Implement the following methods:

- `enqueue`
  - Arguments: value.
  - Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue, using a **first-in, first-out** approach.
- `dequeue`
  - Arguments: none.
  - Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a **first-in, first-out** approach.

> NOTE: The Stack instances have only `push`, `pop`, and `peek` methods.
>
> You should use your own Stack implementation.
>
> Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

### Unit Tests

For each method that you define, write test assertions for the following conditions at **minimum**:

- “Happy Path” - Expected outcome
- Expected failure
- Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)
