## 15: Implementation

> Branch Name: `trees`
>
> Challenge Type: `New Implementation`

---

### Features

Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order
Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.
Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## 16: Tree-Max

Find the maximum value in a Binary Tree.

---

## 17: Breadth-First Traversal

Breadth-First Traversal.

> Branch Name: `tree-breadth-first`
>
> Challenge Type: `Code Challenge / Algorithm`

---

### Feature Tasks

Write a function called `breadthFirst()`.

Breadth-first traversal iterates through the tree, by going through each level of the tree, node-by-node.

- Arguments: `tree`
- Returns: List of all values in the tree, in the order that they were encountered.
